###VARIABLE SCOPE
-- Global Variable :
              - declare in (__main__) is Global variable
              - the variable declare outside of the function is also Global Variable
              - accessible anywhere in the program 
-- Local Variable : 
              - declare in functions
              - accessible only inside the functions
              
Age = 20 
Age = 30 Re-assigning a different value to the same variable

most other programming languages except python, the two valriable have same memory addresses
but it not same in python case, in python variables do not have fixed locations.The location changes every time their value changes.
# EXPLAINATION : the variable Age is created as a label pointing to a memory location where 20 is already stored. 
If 20 is not present in any of the memory locations, then 20 is stored in an empty memory location with a unique address and then the Age is made to point to that memory location.

*NOTE :  when we create a variable, we actually create an object somewhere in the memory with a unique mapping or ID/Address.In python memory address can get using 'id()' method.

###TYPECASTING
 - use to convert one data type to another data type
 --Implicit Type Conversion :
             - no user intervestion require
             - automatically python give the data type 
             example : >a = 2.3
                       >print(type(a))
                       
 --Explicit Type Conversion :
             - understand from below example
             example : >a = 2.23
                       >n = int(a)
                       >print(type(a))
                       >print(type(n))
